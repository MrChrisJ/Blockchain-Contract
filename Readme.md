# Blockchain Contract

## Goal
The goal of this project is to produce a legal contract that is both consistent with the Western Legal tradition and that can also be notarised in the Bitcoin blockchain using nothing but available open source tools.  

We will be using [Extensible Markup Language (XML)](http://www.w3schools.com/xml/), PGP and a Blockchain notorisation service called [Proof of Existence](http://proofofexistence.com/). By combining the contract with a [Blockchain ID](https://github.com/MrChrisJ/World-Citizenship) we aim to bind the agreement to individuals in such a way that the contract becomes enforceable in a court of law.  

As with other projects on this Github my hope is to increase people’s  understanding of the underlying technology and transfer power from the experts to the people. I want to enable everyone to use these tools with confidence so that they may manage their agreements between one another peacefully and achieve their life’s goals.
